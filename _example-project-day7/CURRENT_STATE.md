## Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Focus:** Contractor quote comparison and reference checks
**Outcome:**
- Created comparison spreadsheet (quotes/comparison.md)
- Called 3 references, reached 2 (both for Summit)
- Identified key differences: ABC is $7K cheaper but Summit has better reviews and includes appliance installation

**Left off:**
- Waiting for ABC's 2nd reference to call back
- Need to visit showroom before countertop decision
- Should ask ABC if they can match Summit's appliance installation inclusion
